This python module is used for the creation of PNG images. It is designed for
ease of use. Its API is defined below.

Module pypng:
    rgb:
        color type for red, green, blue with no alpha channel.
        bit depths 8 and 16 allowed.
        form for colors is a python list with 3 integer sample values: [r,g,b]
    rgb_alpha:
        color type for red, green, blue with alpha channel.
        bit depths 8 16 allowed.
        form [r,g,b,a] a is max transparency at 0, opaque at max value
    gray:
        color type for grayscale with no alpha channel
        bitdepths 1,2,4,8,16 allowed
        form [g] g is brighness of pixel
    gray_alpha:
        color type for grayscale with alpha channel
        bit depths 1,2,4,8,16 allowed
        form [g,a] g is brightness, a is opacity
    paletted:
        color type for paletted colors
        only bit depth 8 is allowed
        add color of form [r,g,b] to palette with 'add_palette_color(c)' method
            returns palette code for this color (of form [p])
    Png class:
        __init__(width, height, color type, bit depth, interlace):
            width: integer specifying how many pixels wide image will be
            height: integer specifying how many pixels tall image will be
            color type: types described above
            bit_depth: valid values described per color type above
            interlace: True if interlaced, False if not interlaced
        set_pixel(x,y,color):
            x: integer x value in image (0,0 is top left)
            y: integer y value in image (0,0 is top left)
            color: python list of integer sample values (EX: [255,128,64])
        write(filename):
            filename: string name of file to write to


Example of use:
### BEGIN SNIPPET ###
from pypng import Png
image = Png(10,10) # width, height of 10
for y in range(10):
    for x in range (10):
        image.set_pixel([10 * (x + y), abs(20*(x - y)), abs(20*(y - x))])
        # note that the color is an array of length 3 with an integer value
        # of 0 - 255
image.write('test_image.png')
### END SNIPPET ###
